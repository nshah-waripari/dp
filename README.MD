### DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING  ###
Using the technique of 'memoization' and 'tabulation' as a part of Dynamic Programming paradygm to 
solve a few the following programming problems (using javascript) listed below:
1. Fibonacci
2. Grid Traveler
3. canSum
4. howSum
5. bestSum
6. canConstruct
7. countConstruct
8. allConstruct

#### Solving Problem using Dynamic Programming:
Tabulation:
1. Visualize the problem as a table
2. Size the table based on the inputs
3. Initialize the table with default values
4. Seed the trivial answer into the table aka base case
5. Iterate through table
6. Fill further position based on the current position

Memoization:
1. Make it work (brute force approach)
    <ul> Visualize the problem as tree </ul>
    <ul> Implement the tree as recursion </ul>
    <ul> Test it </ul>
2. Make it efficient
    <ul> Add a memo (dictionary) object </ul>
    <ul> Add a base case to return memo values </ul>
    <ul> Store return values into the memo </ul>
